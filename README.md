# kMeansClustering
This is a java code showing kMeans clustering for the dataset provided. I have attached noth the dataset and the library
I used for generating the charts. It also generates the graph for the SSE vs k, and clearly shows 
the occurrance of the "knee" or inflexion point which is the best value of k. 

I have created a class inside this file called cluster which is the respresentation of the cluster. 
You can go through the comments if you need more details of the code.
